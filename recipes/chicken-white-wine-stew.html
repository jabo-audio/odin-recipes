    <h2 class="white">Chicken stew with a white whine kick!</h2>
    
    <p>Although we live in Houston, using stew to meal-prep has been a big help in our journey to eat healthy. White wine lasts longer in our house than red, so I wanted to find recipes that could help us be as economical with our purchases as possible. This recipe also doubles as something we can serve our friends and family that are gluten-free and dairy-free with the right substitutions</p>

    <h2 class="white">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 tbsp worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tsp chopped rosemary</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion</li>
            <li>3 large carrots, peeled and cut</li>
            <li>1 lb yukon gold potatoes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cream or milk</li>
            <li>2/3 cup frozen peas</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h2 class="white">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp olive oil to a skillet and place on high heat. Add the chicken and season, searing the meat.</li>
            <li>Add the meat, broth, white wine, worcestershire, balsamic vinegar, thyme, rosemary, oregano, salt, and pepper into the slow cooker.</li>
            <li>Stir until combined.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, onion chunks, carrots and diced potatoes. Stir again.</li>
            <li>cover and cook on low for 7-8 hours or high for 4-5</li>
            <li>Remove 1/2 cup of chicken broth from the slow cooker and transfer to a medium bowl. Stir in 1/2 cup of milk or cream and whisk the flour in until there are no lumps. Add this mixture back to the slow cooker and combine.</li>
