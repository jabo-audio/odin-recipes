        <h2>Beef curry with adjustable heat!</h2>
        <p>This beef curry is a hit in our household. Chicken has easily become the number one go to protein for us, and while I am no stranger to eating the same thing over-and-over again, my wife rightly believes in variety. That's how we came to this beef curry! While Madras is not a traditional Indian curry, we found that this was easy for us to make a good product, something that we have struggled with in attempts to make traditional Indian recipes.</p>

        <p>While Madras is not a traditional Indian curry, we enjoy this slow cooker version and hope you will too!</p>
