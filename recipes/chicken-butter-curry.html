        <h2>Butter chicken curry with non-dairy options!</h2>

        <p>My wife and I love chicken, and finding different ways to cook and flavor it! This style of curry originated in India in the 1950s. This serves as an easy butter chicken recipe, with the dairy products interchangeable with coconut products to help make this dish dairy-free!</p>

       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 tbsp coconut oil</li>
            <li>1 small yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 tbsp minced fresh ginger</li>
            <li>4 cloves minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp curry powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp garam masala</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp chili powder</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>6 oz can of tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 small cauliflower</li>
            <li>1 can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup half-and-half</li>
            <li>1/2 cup greek yoghurt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the coconut oil in a nonstick skillet. Once hot, add onion and cook until beginning to soften. Add giger, garlic, curry, garam masala, chili powder, salt, and tomato paste. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture to the slow cooker. Put the chicken cut into pieces on top, then the cauliflower, topping with tomato sauce. Stir to combine. Scatter the butter pieces around on top</li>
            <li>Cover and cook on high for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours or on low for 4-6 hours.</li>
            <li>Check the chicken to make sure it is at least 165 degrees. Take out and cook longer as needed in a separate pan.</li>
            <li>If the cauliflower is not tender, continue to cook on HIGH, up to 1 hour longer.</li> 
            <li>Return chicken to pan and  then stir in the half-and-half. Let cool for a few minutes, and then stir in the greek yoghurt.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Enjoy!</p>
