        <h2>Slow Cooker Meal Prep Recipes</h2>
        <p>These slow cooker recipes have become a hit in my household. Being a new parent is a full time job, one that you add on top of everything else that you do during the day. Cooking quickly became something that we looked to simplify - unfortunately it led to us often eating something quick and unhealthy. Remembering my time as a bachelor, I talked to my wife about meal prepping ahead of time. Luckily, she used to do this too, and we agreed that this could help us make healthier decisions <em>and</em> spend less time making our meals. Below are three of our staple picks!</p>
